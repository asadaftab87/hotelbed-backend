Pipelines for Price in Hotelbeds Cache API
 Integration
 
What are Price Pipelines?
In the Hotelbeds Cache API integration, a price pipeline refers to the structured sequence of
processing steps that transform raw hotel rate data (net rates, promotions, policies, fees, taxes, and
FX) into the final end-user payable price (E.P.P). This ensures accurate, consistent, and
customer-ready prices.
Why Pipelines?
Price pipelines provide a standardized, modular approach to price computation. They make the
process easier to maintain, test, and scale while ensuring that every applicable business rule is
applied in the correct order.
Typical Steps in a Price Pipeline
1. **Ingest (Data Retrieval)**: Fetch net rates, availability, promotions, policies, fees, taxes, and FX
rates. 2. **Normalization & Eligibility**: Deduplicate rate keys, validate sellability (stop-sale,
allotment, min/max stay), and determine applicable promotions. 3. **Promotion Engine**: Apply
discount rules based on the combinability matrix (exclusive vs. cumulative promotions). 4. **Fees &
Taxes Application**: Add mandatory surcharges, city taxes, and child/extra-bed fees. 5. **Currency
Conversion & Rounding**: Convert to EUR (or required currencies) and apply rounding rules. 6.
**Aggregation**: Select the cheapest sellable option per hotel/date/LOS/occupancy. Retain
alternatives for product detail pages (e.g., refundable vs. non-refundable, with/without breakfast). 7.
**Output & Storage**: Store results in the cache/index with fields such as E.P.P, board type,
cancellation class, badges, and metadata like timestamp and version.
Key Benefits
- **Modularity**: Each component (promotion engine, tax calculation, FX) can be tested or updated
independently. - **Reusability**: The same pipeline can serve precompute jobs, delta updates, and
live fallback. - **Traceability**: Logs and audits can show exactly how each price was derived. -
**Scalability**: Pipelines can be parallelized to handle millions of hotel/date combinations efficiently.
Summary
Price pipelines are the backbone of price computation in Hotelbeds Cache API integration. They
ensure that raw supplier rates are consistently transformed into accurate end-user payable prices
(E.P.P), while supporting high performance, maintainability, and business rule compliance.
